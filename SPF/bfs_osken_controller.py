"""BFS SPF OpenFlow controller.

Single-source shortest path forwarding using Breadth-First Search.
BFS is the simplest possible unweighted shortest-path algorithm and serves
as the baseline for teaching: it guarantees minimum hop count because it
explores nodes level by level, ensuring the first time a node is reached
it is via the shortest path.

Complexity:   O(V + E) — linear in graph size (optimal for unweighted graphs)
Metric:       hop count (all edges weight 1)
Multipath:    no - single best path per (src, dst)
ECMP:         no

When to use BFS vs Dijkstra:
    BFS:      unweighted graphs, simplest implementation, O(V+E) optimal
    Dijkstra: weighted graphs, O((V+E) log V), degrades to BFS when weights=1
    A*:       like Dijkstra + heuristic, faster with a good h(v), single-target

Run:
    python3 bfs_osken_controller.py
    python3 bfs_osken_controller.py --verbose

    The simplest possible minimum-hop-count router.  BFS explores all
    neighbours at the current hop-distance before moving to the next,
    so the first time any node is reached it is guaranteed to be on a
    shortest path.

    Teaching note — BFS vs Dijkstra on an unweighted graph:
        BFS uses a plain deque (FIFO): cost to reach level k is always k.
        Dijkstra uses a min-heap: generalises to arbitrary positive weights.
        On hop-count topologies they return the same distances; BFS is faster
        because it avoids heap operations.
