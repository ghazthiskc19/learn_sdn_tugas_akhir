"""A* (A-star) heuristic shortest path algorithm.

A* is an informed search algorithm that extends Dijkstra by incorporating
a heuristic estimate h(n) of the remaining cost from node n to the goal.
It expands nodes in order of f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the known
cost from source to n.

Complexity:  O((V + E) log V)  with a consistent (monotone) heuristic
Use when:    A good heuristic is available that reduces search space.
Limitation:  Heuristic must be admissible (never overestimates true cost).

Key advantage over Dijkstra:
    When h(n) is exact (no overestimation), A* expands only nodes on the
    optimal path and avoids expanding nodes that cannot improve the solution.
    In hop-count routing, reverse BFS gives an exact lower bound.

A* for SDN:
    The network graph is small (tens of switches), so the heuristic savings
    are modest.  A* is included here to teach the concept and demonstrate
    how informed search differs from blind Dijkstra.

    admissible and consistent, guaranteeing A* finds the optimal path.
