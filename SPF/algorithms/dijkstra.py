"""Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Dijkstra finds shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes
in a graph with *non-negative* edge weights.  It uses a min-heap (priority
queue) to always expand the closest unvisited node (greedy strategy).

Complexity:  O((V + E) log V)  time with a binary heap,  O(V)  space
Use when:    Edge weights are non-negative (hop count, delay, cost, etc.).
Limitation:  Incorrect on graphs with negative-weight edges.

Two functions are provided:
    dijkstra()              – returns the single best predecessor per node.
    dijkstra_multi_parent() – returns ALL equal-cost predecessors, needed
                              for ECMP (equal-cost multipath) enumeration.
