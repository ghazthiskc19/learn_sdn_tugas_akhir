"""Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.

Bellman-Ford relaxes ALL edges repeatedly for |V|-1 rounds, guaranteeing
that the shortest path is found even when edge weights are negative.
It also detects negative-weight cycles (where no finite shortest path exists).

Complexity:  O(V * E)  time,  O(V)  space
             With early termination O(l * E) where l = shortest path length
Use when:    Edge weights may be negative (e.g., delay improvements, credits).
Limitation:  Slower than Dijkstra for non-negative weights.

Routing protocol analogy:
    Bellman-Ford is the foundation of distance-vector protocols (RIP, BGP).
    Each router iteratively exchanges distance estimates with neighbours until
    convergence — this is precisely Bellman-Ford distributed over a network.
    The "count-to-infinity" problem in RIP occurs when a node becomes
    unreachable and routers keep incrementing estimates indefinitely.
