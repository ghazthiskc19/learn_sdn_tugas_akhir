"""Breadth-First Search shortest path algorithm.

BFS finds the shortest path (minimum hop count) in an *unweighted* graph.
It explores nodes level by level, guaranteeing the first time a node is
reached its distance is optimal.

Complexity:  O(V + E)  time,  O(V)  space
Use when:    All edges have equal cost (hop-count routing).
Limitation:  Cannot handle weighted edges.

Comparison with Dijkstra:
    BFS uses a FIFO queue.  All edge weights are implicitly 1.
    Dijkstra uses a min-heap.  Edges may have different non-negative weights.
    On unweighted graphs BFS is faster in practice (no heap overhead).
