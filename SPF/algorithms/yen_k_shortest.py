"""Yen's K-shortest simple paths algorithm.

Yen's algorithm finds the K shortest loopless paths between src and dst
in a directed (or undirected) weighted graph.

Algorithm overview:
    1. Find the shortest path A[0] using Dijkstra.
    2. For k = 1 … K-1:
       a. For each spur node i along path A[k-1]:
          - Remove edges that would immediately duplicate an existing path.
          - Remove all nodes in root_path[0..i-1] to avoid cycles.
          - Run Dijkstra from spur_node to dst on the restricted graph.
          - If a spur path is found, candidate = root_path + spur_path.
       b. Add the cheapest candidate to A.

Complexity:  O(K * V * (E + V log V))  time
Use when:    Multiple diverse paths are needed for ECMP load balancing,
             failover, or traffic engineering.

ECMP relevance:
    OpenFlow SELECT groups distribute traffic across multiple next hops.
    K-shortest paths (K=2 or 4) provides the bucket list for the group.
    Even when all paths have equal hop count Yen's algorithm correctly
    enumerates them if we treat them as having equal cost.
