"""Widest-path (maximum-bottleneck) shortest path algorithm.

The widest path maximises the *minimum edge bandwidth* along the path —
the path whose bottleneck link has the highest bandwidth.  This is useful
for Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing where available bandwidth matters more
than hop count.

Also known as: maximum-capacity path, max-min bandwidth path.

Algorithm:
    Modified Dijkstra where:
    - "distance" is replaced by *maximum achievable bottleneck bandwidth*
    - We use a max-heap (negate bandwidth for Python's min-heap)
    - Relaxation: bottleneck(u→v) = min(bottleneck_so_far[u], bandwidth(u,v))
    - We keep the path with the highest bottleneck

Complexity:  O((V + E) log V)  time,  O(V)  space
Use when:    Link bandwidths are known and you want maximum throughput paths.
Limitation:  Requires accurate bandwidth information per link.

Example (why widest path ≠ shortest path):
    s1 ─(10 Mbps)─ s2 ─(10 Mbps)─ s3   (2 hops, bottleneck = 10 Mbps)
    s1 ─(100 Mbps)─────────────── s3    (1 hop,  bottleneck = 100 Mbps)
    Shortest path: s1→s2→s3 (2 hops)
    Widest path:   s1→s3    (100 Mbps bottleneck — 10× better bandwidth)
