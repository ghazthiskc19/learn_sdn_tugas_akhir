"""Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest paths algorithm.

Floyd-Warshall uses dynamic programming to compute shortest paths between
every pair of nodes in a single O(V^3) pass.  For each intermediate node k,
it checks whether routing through k improves any pairwise distance.

Complexity:  O(V^3)  time,  O(V^2)  space
Use when:    You need ALL pairs of shortest paths upfront (e.g., in a
             centralised SDN controller with a small number of switches).
Limitation:  Impractical for large networks (> ~100 switches due to O(V^3)).
             Cannot handle negative-weight cycles.

SDN advantage:
    A centralised controller has global topology visibility, making all-pairs
    precomputation natural.  After a topology change, the controller can
    recompute all-pairs paths and proactively push flows for all known hosts.
    This avoids per-packet path computation latency.

Comparison with Dijkstra:
    Dijkstra (single-source): O((V+E) log V) — run once per source.
    Floyd-Warshall (all-pairs): O(V^3) — single pass for all pairs.
    Break-even: Floyd-Warshall wins when V^3 < V * (V+E) log V,
                approximately when E >> V (dense graphs).
